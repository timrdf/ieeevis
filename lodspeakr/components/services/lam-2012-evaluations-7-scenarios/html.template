         <h1>How the visualization community evaluates</h1>
         <p>
            Heidi Lam <i>et al.</i> surveyed 800 papers from four different visualization venues 
            (InfoVis, EuroVis, VAST, and Journal of Information Visualization) between 1995 and 2011. 
            They categorized 361 papers according to the kind of evaluation that was presented (approximately 400 papers did not evaluate their work). 
            The chart below shows the occurrences of each evaluation category from 1995 to 2011; 
            it replicates Figure 2 in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.279">Heidi Lam <i>et al.'s paper</i></a>.

         <p>However, the figure above is <b>more than just a replica</b> of the original -- it was created given <b>only</b> 
          <a href="http://ieeevis.tw.rpi.edu/source/datahub.io/file/vis-seven-scenarios-codings/version/2013-Mar-08/manual/ScenarioPaperopencodingcleancopy.txt.xml.ttl.v6.graffle">this content-preserved OmniGraffle file</a> (and the same thing could have been done from <a href="http://ieeevis.tw.rpi.edu/lam-2012-evaluations-2-categories">this d3.js replica of their Figure 1</a>, or <a href="">this SVG file</a> created using another system, or even <a href="">this GraphML</a> file). 
            Using a content-preserved graphic and the content-augmentation technique described in our VAST 2013 paper enabled us to access the data depicted in the original graphic.
            In addition, the figure above is also content-preserved, meaning that anyone can reconstruct and repurpose the data shown in the figure.
